# Part 2 Popular Artist Writeup:
I think this is an okay way of rating popularity however 
I can also see how it is not always the most accurate. 
They might have a lot of songs that are in the top100 list but
that does not necessarily mean they are the most popular.
I think popularity depends on how many listens each artist/track gets.
The more listens, the more popular they are. 
# Part 3 - Data Visualization Writeup:

### Plot 3.1 interpretation:
From the graph of speechiness vs danceability for rap music and 
not rap music it becomes apparent that rap music is higher on the speechy
scale and higher on the danceability scale. 

Spotify's rating of 
danceability comes from how suitable the track is for dancing
based on criteria such as beat strength, tempo, etc. From the plot
I am not sure how much I agree with this. There are a lot of different 
ways of dancing many of which cannot be done to rap music. I would 
say that their reading of danceability is not including many types of 
dance. Just because rap music tends to have a stronger beat and such
does not mean it is danceable. 


Spotify's rating of speechiness comes from a measurement of the 
amount of spoken word type sound there is in the track.
A lot of the rap music lies higher on the speechiness scale although
a lot of the songs are mixed in to the non-rap music. I think 
this is a good level of speechiness, a lot of music that is considered
rap music has a fair amount of instrumental, and some sort of chorus
that does not always include rap bringing it down on the speechiness scale.

### Found in exploration:
##### Question:
I found it interesting how there was a list of artists for 
each track. I was then curious if the number of artists
affects the length of the song as there are now more people
who need their time to be featured. I also wanted to see if there
was a relationship between the energy of a song and its length. 
I had noticed before that generally really long songs tend to be on the slower, 
more melancholic side. The questions I came up with were therefore:

How does the duration of a song relate to the number 
of artists and the energy of the song? 


Are the songs longer when there are more artists?


Are shorter songs typically higher energy?
##### Answer:
There does not appear to be a correlation between the number of 
artists and the duration. All the tracks with more than one 
artist appears to be averaged with the tracks that have one artist. 
I was actually expecting songs with more artists to have a higher 
duration as they all need to make their contribution to the song
and am quite surprised to see that this does not seem to be the case. 


There does not appear to be a truly clear relationship between 
energy and duration either. However, it is apparent that there are no songs
with a high duration and a high energy. Nor is there a track in the 
Top100 that is long with low energy. It is interesting that most
of the songs in the top100 are on the higher end of the energy scale.

# Part 4 - Extra:
For part 4 I tried plotly, I had not used it before and 
wanted to see if it was any easier than matplotlib.
I produced a similar graph to the one I did for part three 
except I made the y-axis tempo instead of energy. 
I also enabled the hover function so one can see what song each
dot represents. 


From the graph below I deduced that there does not appear to be a clear
relationship between tempo and song duration. Generally the tempo
does appear to be on the mid to low side as the songs get longer, 
there are not any songs off the top100 that have a high tempo
for a longer than average time. 

I would say I liked using plotly a lot 
more than matplotlib.
